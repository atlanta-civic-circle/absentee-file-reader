# Download an absentee voter file from the  Georgia Secretary of State's website: 
# https://elections.sos.ga.gov/Elections/voterabsenteefile.do

# No example is uploaded to this repo because the file is too big. 

# The file will be a zipped file with a number, probably like 32629.zip
# 
# STATEWIDE.csv is the hero file within that directory -- it's got all the absentee ballots listed.
# The other files in that zipped directory are just the same data, but split up into file for each county.

# So, the SoS generates a new absentee zip file every day. To get a different day's data, you have to
# download the data on that day.

# out_path is where I'm going to save a summary of accpted ballots grouped by county.
# I want to bake the date into the filename, Oct 26 2022, so I don't mix up different day's files.
# out_headers is going to be the column name in my outfile that shows county and number of accepted votes
